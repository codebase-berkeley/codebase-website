  - question: What is a CodeBase project and what can I get out of one?
    answer: >
      Each semester, we work with a number of Bay Area tech companies to implement a project together. What the project is can vary - among other things, we’ve built full-stack web applications, mobile apps, and offered machine learning consulting. What you get out of a project will be a solid grasp of software development, having built and delivered a tangible product with a team of engineers end-to-end
  - question: What should I expect as a developer on a CodeBase project?
    answer: >
      As a Developer on a CodeBase project, you’ll be working with 6-8 other members and 2 Project Managers. Each project typically spans about 12 weeks and includes a mid-semester deliverable (you can think of these as “due dates”) at around Week 6, a final deliverable at around Week 12. The work you do and the time commitment you put in will be at the discretion of your Project Managers, but in previous projects, developers could expect to put in anywhere from 10-12 hours of work per week as well as a 1-hour for a weekly club General Meeting
  - question: What is the difference between the Mentored Team and the Client Team?
    answer: >
      The Mentored Team is intended for bright students with an interest computer science who don’t have a lot of experience yet; historically, the project has been an internal with the goal of teaching students the fundamentals of software development. The Client Teams are for students with demonstrated skill in computer science - Client Teams work with startups to deliver a real product by the end of the semester. If you haven’t coded too much but would like to dip your feet into software development, apply for the Mentored Team. On the other hand, if you’ve worked on larger projects before and would like to gain experience on software for industry, apply for the Client Teams
  - question: What kind of candidate is CodeBase looking for?
    answer: >
      Our ideal candidates are tenacious problem solvers, imaginative inventors, and fearless students with a knack for asking the right questions and a willingness to try things that might not work. While an aptitude for computer science is important, we’re not looking for any particular skill set or background - our members come from all sorts of experience levels, have all sorts of passions and interests, and we’re always looking for people to join our motley crew. Our Base Behaviors are a great place to start!
