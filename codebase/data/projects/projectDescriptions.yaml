beam:
  intro: >
    Beam Financial is a mobile-first online banking platform that offers 2-4% APY on your assets stored in their system. Through the Beam app, users can invite their friends to gain daily interest rate rewards, called Billies. The platform is zero-fees, no interest rate, and FDIC insured.
  problem: >
    During our working period with Beam, their lean engineering team was fully focused on the initial launch of their application to the iOS App Store. Many of the backend and database systems were in place, but the engineers had no easy way to query for and visualize their data.
    <br> <br> Our job was to build, from scratch, an internal facing administration dashboard for various Beam data. This included a standardized table view of Customers, Transactions, Interest Rates, etc. as well as visualizations and core metrics for Beam to track their performance over time. We were to own this project from end-to-end - everything from initial Google OAuth authentication to deploying the application on their Heroku instances.
  implementation: >
    The implementation of the project happened in 2 pieces. The first of which was a frontend in React.js and TypeScript that queried data from our backend to display in various formats and communicated with AWS Cognito and Google OAuth for user authentication. The second was our GraphQL backend layer, built on top of Beam’s own Postgres databases. We implemented a one-to-one GraphQL mapping with Postgres, implemented our own custom endpoints, and also ran daily CRON jobs for aggregation metrics.
  challenges: >
    Once we moved our development process in to Beam’s QA database, we became painfully aware that many of our data operations could not be handled on the client side. This meant ripping out much of our frontend code, and implementing, among other things, server-side data pagination, server-side data sorting, and server-side fuzzy search. These technical challenges, combined with our relative unfamiliarity with GraphQL, proved to be a time-consuming roadblock.
    <br> <br> The authentication flow in our application resulted in quite a bit of churn in our application. We were trying to integrate AWS Cognito, Google OAuth 2.0, and both our React application and backend GraphQL servers all into one seamless workflow. Our users were to hit a Google sign in link on our React application, have it be okayed by Google OAuth, redirect to AWS Cognito, quickly confirm with our GraphQL layer, swing back to AWS Cognito to, and then finally confirm with our React frontend. There was no simple fix for this and we had to get our hands dirty with each request in the pipeline.
  takeaways: >
    In retrospect, there were still a couple pieces of the project specification that were not clear, and we ran into some trouble near the end of the project trying to clarify expectations. Beam did not provide a dedicated designer on the application and we should have allocated more design resources, on our end, towards the project.
    <br> <br> Everyone on the team still learned a lot from the experience. It’s not often a team gets to own the entire life of an application from end-to-end like we did. Building a web application with concretely definable tasks allowed us to focus on operations, coding practices, and teamwork. Our final application was running on real Beam data and offered real, tangible insights for Beam employees.

propelx:
  intro: >
    Propel(x) is an investing platform that allows investors to browse and fund promising startups. Using the platform, investors can view startup pitch decks, ask questions about the startups, view detailed information about the startups, and commit to investments.
  problem: >
    Propel(x) originally had a desktop-only interface and were interested in exploring different ways of communicating information to their users. They specifically wanted to target users who were browsing on-the-go on their phones, and to get them interacting with the platform even when they weren’t near a laptop.
    <br> <br> Our job was to build a mobile application that gives users the ability to access certain core features of the desktop interface. This includes a Tinder-like home view where investors can swipe through startup cards. Pressing on startup cards they are interested in brings users to an expanded view that allows them to access detailed startup information. In addition, users are able to save startups for later and view them in a list.
  implementation: >
    The mobile app was written in React Native, and we used a wide variety of React Native packages to get the UI components needed for the app. To hook our frontend up to Propel(x)’s backend, we were given several endpoints to work with, which gave developers the opportunity to work with REST and figure out how to parse endpoint responses.
  challenges: >
    One of our biggest challenges had to do with managing state information. We decided not to use Redux to manage state for a few reasons. For one, the app is relatively lightweight in terms of the information we have to pull from the backend. Additionally, every single developer on the team was new to React Native, and with only 10 weeks or so for the project, I decided to have them focus on learning the core technology and not have to worry about Redux (which has a bit of a learning curve). However, this meant that we did not have a central store of information and a single source of truth for everything happening in the app, and would have to have individual pages communicate changes in state to each other in the frontend. We created a workaround by setting our source of truth to be a frontend component, which acted as a central store, making GET and POST requests to the backend, and sending and receiving information to and from the individual pages in the app.
    <br> <br> Another challenge was figuring out how to implement swiping. Most existing React Native packages for swiping were a little finicky and didn’t fit our use case well. We had to apply some creative styling and fixes to existing packages to get swiping to function the way the client wanted it to.
  takeaways: >
    The Propel(x) project was a wonderful learning experience for everybody involved—the client enjoyed the opportunity to build relationships with college students, the developers all picked up new skills and grew as engineers as they tackled challenge after challenge, and I gained a lot of insight into what it means to lead and manage a team. In retrospect, there were a few things that could have been done better (maybe it would have been worth it from an engineering and code style standpoint to invest time into learning Redux, or maybe we could have worked with Propel(x) to develop a UI equally as interesting as swiping but not as finicky and difficult to wrangle together), but overall the partnership was successful and we were able to deliver on all the functionality that we promised! At the conclusion of the project, Propel(x) hired a mobile engineer to take over the app development, and hopes to release a production version soon.

polymorph-ua:
  intro: >
    Polymorph is an ad-tech startup based in SF, and it focuses on creating a white-label suite for publishers who want to create, manage, and display ads on their own websites and applications. Polymorph focuses on native ads, which are ads that fit within the context of the page. So clients who use Polymorph want to use certain areas of their page to display ads to earn revenue, and Polymorph facilitates this process of choosing which ads to display to maximize revenue. Polymorph’s platform is white-labelled, meaning that the ads appear as if they were created by the site displaying the ads, meaning these ad insertions feel natural for users. The company’s suite currently serves 15,000 + sites/apps, and can process 100,00 ad requests per second.
  problem: >
    In order to serve both advertisers and publishers who want to sell ad space, Polymorph holds auctions for advertisers to bid on ad spaces to place their ads. Polymorph conducts both direct auctions and third-party auctions. For direct auctions, Polymorph handles the bidding for the advertisers, and uses stats and metrics from these advertisers to calculate a bidding price. For third-party auctions, Polymorph receives bids from third-party advertisers and uses the bids set by these third-parties.
    <br> <br> There are multiple units used for bidding, two of which are CPC (cost per click) and CPM (cost per thousand ads loaded). Direct auctions allow bids in both CPC and CPM, while third-party only allow bids in CPM.  Our job was to predict CTR, which is the probability a user clicks on an ad given that the ad is loaded on their webpage. The purpose of this project is to efficiently and accurately convert between the above-mentioned two units of measurement for bidding since direct auctions has bids using both units.
  implementation: >
    This being an ML project, we first looked at existing papers on calculating CPC. Luckily, there have already been previous competitions and attempts to calculate CPC and we tried creating models based on previous literature. Before getting started, we analyzed the data given to us with exploratory data analysis to visually determine useful features and randomly subsampled features hundreds of times for feature selection. We experimented with 4 models: field-aware factorization machines, random forests, logistic regression, and gradient boosting. In order to measure accuracy, we used various units of measurements, such as log-loss and f1 score, and also used grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
  challenges: >
    The biggest technical challenge was both the lack of data and the poor quality of the data. The initial data set given had too few positive samples (data for clicked ads), so models always returned a prediction of no-click since it didn’t have enough data for clicked ads. Additionally, there weren’t too many useful features in that many of the features given (such as the country and browser of the user) did not tell us much in terms of whether or not the user would click the ad. Thus, our models simply didn’t have enough quality data to train on and this threw them off considerably. After the mid-semester deliverable, we were able to get more and more specific data, and this helped our models.
    <br> <br>  Another technical challenge was standardizing feature selection and hyperparameter values. Everyone took ownership of a separate model and worked in a separate ipython notebook, so near the end, people had different procedures for selecting features and tuning hyperparameters. Making sure that we standardized these procedures was essential in ensuring final results were comparable.
  takeaways: >
    In retrospect, the project was intriguing conceptually, and we had a lot of fun trying to predict CTR, but there were still many roadblocks we faced given the data issues and the fact that with such a large dataset, iterative changes took days.
    <br> <br> Everyone on the team still learned a lot from the experience. Many members did not have much previous exposure to machine learning, and this was a very practical and face-paced, albeit rocky, introduction to machine learning. Learning about the pipeline for creating a working machine learning model was incredibly intellectually stimulating, in that the actual model is only the tip of the iceberg-to create such a model. Hours and hours of data cleaning and examination, parameter tuning, and model training were required. Often times, doing this randomly until the best possible result emerge actually worked the best.

resultcare:
  intro: >
    ResultCare is a healthcare mobile platform that allows medical professionals to browse and share information on diagnoses, tests and research papers. The goal of the project was to make the platform more social to incentivize professionals to interact with others and the app.
  problem: >
    ResultCare already had a database of thousands of research papers, diagnoses and lab tests. However, in order to make the app more than just a large mobile collection of data, the platform had to implement social aspects to keep users returning and interacting. Our team was given the main task of adding social features and integration to the existing backend and mobile application.
    / More specifically, the first half of the project involved adding social network features such as likes, followers and messaging to the ResultCare backend. The second half the project involved implementing new pages for these social features in native Android, using the endpoints that we created in the first few months.
  implementation: >
    The backend portion of the project was adding to ResultCare’s existing stack, which was mostly based in PostgreSQL and Node.js. We added endpoints to support Q&A, recent activity tracking, followers for users, reviews for lab tests and messaging between users. The native Android portion was completed using Android Studio, Java and XML. We created Android activities for messaging, user profile, community and reviews, along with infrastructure to communicate with the new backend API endpoints.
    / Another technical challenge was connecting the backend API endpoints to the Android application. Figuring out how to make API requests in parallel and properly parse the data was a much larger task than we initially anticipated, since we had to ensure both security and request speed. Native Android is definitely a challenging platform to work with and we all learned a lot from the experience.
  challenges: >
    One major technical challenge was building upon ResultCare’s existing applications and codebase. Their Android application, initially built several years ago, was still on a very old version of Android, which meant that we had to work with the older framework and features. As well, their backend functions and existing API were difficult to understand at first, which slowed down development, especially in the first few weeks.
  takeaways: >
    In general, ResultCare was an amazing learning opportunity for all the members involved, as well as a great opportunity for the company to increase campus presence and finish features for a full launch. There are definitely areas I wish I planned better and certain tasks I underestimated, but overall I believe that the team gained a lot of insight into working with startups, effective client communication and software engineering as an industry. Currently, the ResultCare app is in beta testing with hopes to launch to Android and iOS markets soon.

yituux:
  intro: >
    YiTuuX develops and markets artificial intelligence and machine learning based tools to enable healthcare workers. The increased use of modern medical equipment, lab tests, etc. has created an information explosion. Physicians have to deal with huge amounts of new information, not only to stay current with the latest developments in medicine, but also to study the growing amounts of information for each one of his, or her patients. YiTuuX’s tools, developed based on the latest development in artificial intelligence and deep learning to assist physicians, and to improve their productivity in diagnosing diseases. With their tools, physicians’ productivity can be easily improved by over 50%, allowing them to focus on more difficult cases and provide more face to face interaction with patients.
  problem: >
    YiTuuX has been working on refining their healthtech tools, and were ready to begin deploying one of their core neural network models. However, AI/ML models are generally notoriously difficult to deploy correctly. YiTuuX wanted Codebase to assist in developing a prototype backend queuing system that was able to split up incoming jobs across multiple machines and a frontend from which users were able to submit jobs to the system. Another goal was to figure out how to handle jobs of incoming priorities so YiTuuX could offer users tiers of service and even corresponding SLAs in the future.
  implementation: >
    We ended up using the incredibly robust services provided by AWS (SQS, EC2, ElasticBeanstalk, S3, etc.) and Django to build out the backend. Users were able to upload jobs to a Django webserver running on Elastic Beanstalk, from which data about the jobs would be sent to SQS and S3. Jobs would be sent to particular queues based on the user’s service plan, and each EC2 instance was running a custom worker script that watched the SQS queues for new jobs, processed them, and uploaded results back to the Django webserver and S3. Throughout this process, users were able to monitor the process of their jobs using a particular URL on the Django server.
  challenges: >
    One of the interesting technical challenges we ran into was trying to get SLAs to work reliably for different tiers of users. After looking extensively at YiTuuX’s particular case, we determined that this would be nearly impossible to do cost-effectively without autoscaling our EC2 instance clusters. Since designing and developing a robust autoscaling backend unfortunately required time that we did not have for the project, we decided to go with the next best thing - designing a custom job-choosing scheme that favored jobs with higher priority.

    Overall this project was a successful learning experience - our developers were able to pick up new skills from each other and the clients were able to build a relationship with Codebase. As a team, we learned a lot about what kinds of things are important for a project to run smoothly - from team internals to client engagement and communication. Overall, the team was able to deliver a working, successful product, while also gaining a lot of insight into software development at startup companies and engineering consulting as a whole. YiTuuX will be able to build off of our ideas and prototype product when deploying their models for customers.

    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
