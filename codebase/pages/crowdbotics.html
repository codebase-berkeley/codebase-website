					The Challenge
				</div>
				<div class="top-section-desc">
					Crowdbotics is a startup automating the process of connecting clients with developing needs with capable engineers.
					Crowdbotics tasked us with building an automated onboarding and technical interviewing slackbot to interview potential
					developer candidates for their platform; essentially, we had to model the dynamics of a tech interview, processing
					natural language input to rank interviewee performance on a variety of technical questions, all while providing a
					robust, conversational experience for users - all in all a terrifically open-ended problem.

					The Solution
				</div>
				<div class="top-section-desc">
					<p>
						Conversational AI is an active area of research, and successfully building a chatbot that can hold simple
						conversations like Microsoftâ€™s Zo requires substantial resources and is regarded as something of an accomplishment.
						Luckily, technical interviews are a forgivingly tiny slice of the entire space of natural language conversations.
						We decided to model the interview through intent trees - a scheme where the chatbot traverses graph nodes depending
						on user input to determine what response to send - and following advice from Professor Denero, used a bag-of-words
						technique for the MVP solution. Technical interview data was crowdsourced.
					</p>
					<p>
						Actually deploying our solution proved to be an unexpectedly challenging engineering problem. Crowdbotics
						asked to use serverless technology like AWS Lambda to bring down costs and enable scalability, but after careful
						evaluation we concluded that loading our NLP models onto AWS Lambda was simply not possible because the stateless
						nature of serverless technology meant we would simply be transferring costs to a whole new
						(slower and more expensive) caching layer. Instead, we worked out a solution where we ran the models on traditional
						EC2 servers and stored conversation data in RDS.
