# CodeBase Website 3.0 (WIP)
### Before You Begin
Check out this awesome guide on the [Hugo directory structure](https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/hugo-directory-structure/)

### Run Instructions
1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
```
brew install hugo
hugo version
```
2. Start the Hugo Server
```
hugo server -D
```
Feel free to reach out to Cindy or Young with any questions about anything at all!

### General Hugo Notes
- The `/layouts` directory is _very_ important. We've set up most of the structure already, and it should be intuitive to jump in, but I would _highly_ recommend gaining some understanding of [Hugo Templates](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) first
- Every page inherits from `layouts/_default/baseof.html`
- Every page inherits from `layouts/_default/single.html`
- Content pages are defined in `content/`
- Pattern matching existing skeleton code will be your friend
